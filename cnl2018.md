This workshop on [Controlled Natural Language (CNL)](index.html) has a broad scope and embraces all approaches that are based on natural language and apply restrictions on vocabulary, grammar, and/or semantics. This includes (but is certainly not limited to) approaches that have been called _simplified language, plain language, formalized language, processable language, fragments of language, phraseologies, conceptual authoring, language generation, and guided natural language interfaces_.

Some CNLs are designed to improve communication among humans, especially for non-native speakers of the respective natural language. In other cases, the restrictions on the language are supposed to make it easier for computers to analyze such texts in order to improve computer-aided, semi-automatic, or automatic translations into other languages. A third group of CNL has the goal to enable reliable automated reasoning and formal knowledge representation from seemingly natural texts. All these types of CNL are covered by this workshop. In particular, we would like to emphasise that this year, we very much welcome contributions from Industry.

### Submissions and Proceedings

We invite researchers to submit papers with novel contributions in the area of CNL. You may submit a long paper (8 pages + 1 page references), a short paper (4 pages), or demonstration/position papers (2 pages extended abstract describing systems or work in progress; in order to save space, these ought not use the ‘abstract’ section of the template). Submissions should be formatted according to the templates that can be found here: [http://www.frontiersinai.com/?q=templates](http://www.frontiersinai.com/?q=templates)

Late breaking results can be submitted as abstracts of no more than 300 words, and can be presented at the workshop in the form of a poster, demo, and/or flash talk. The accepted abstracts will be listed on the website and will be given a 5 minute presentation slot prior to the poster/demo session of the workshop.


### Submit your paper via Easychair:
