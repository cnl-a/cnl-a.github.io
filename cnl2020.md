[The workshop was originally planned for 2020 but was postponed to 2021 due to Covid-19.]

This workshop on [Controlled Natural Language (CNL)](index.html) has a broad
scope and embraces all approaches that are based on natural language and apply
restrictions on vocabulary, grammar, and/or semantics. This includes (but is
certainly not limited to) approaches that have been called _simplified language,
plain language, formalized language, processable language, fragments of
language, phraseologies, conceptual authoring, language generation, and guided
natural language interfaces_.

Some CNLs are designed to improve communication among humans, especially for
non-native speakers of the respective natural language. In other cases, the
restrictions on the language are supposed to make it easier for computers to
analyze such texts in order to improve computer-aided, semi-automatic, or
automatic translations into other languages. A third group of CNL has the goal
to enable reliable automated reasoning and formal knowledge representation from
seemingly natural texts. All these types of CNL are covered by this workshop.

### Submissions and Proceedings

We invite researchers to submit papers with novel contributions in the area of CNL. We are looking for two types of papers, formatted in two-column ACL style:

- Full papers with novel research results and/or in-depth case descriptions should not exceed 8 pages (accepted papers will get a long presentation slot at the workshop)
- Short papers (including demo/white papers) that shortly introduce a system, approach, or opinion should not exceed 4 pages (accepted papers will get a shorter presentation slot at the workshop)

<!--
Submission should be done via EasyChair [here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cnl2020). Full and short paper will be peer-reviewed, and accepted papers will be published in the [ACL Anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/).
-->

There will also be a business track, for which you can submit extended abstracts:

- Business track abstracts of 1 or 2 pages (excluding graphics) describing a business application or business case (accepted abstracts will get a presentation slot in the business track session)
